points to discuss: 

  - (may/07/2022)
     -> should we provide the doctor search path on the patient main page or After the patient selects the create appointment ?
     -> Where are we capturing the doctor's available slots to show it to the patients,I remember we decide to calculate the slots based on the doctor's 
        available time and the wait time , but once the slot is booked , should we maintain a different table to maintain the booked slots or should we calculate everytime the user requests for the available slots ?
